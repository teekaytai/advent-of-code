Python is easily my strongest programming language, so for an extra challenge I'll make golf solutions in addition to writing proper, clean solutions for each day. Where possible, I'll also try solving problems in more *interesting* ways.

| Day | Golf Sizes (bytes) | Tags                    | Remarks |
|:---:|:------------------:|-------------------------|---------|
|  1  |      70, 188       | Brute Force, Rabin Karp |         |
|  2  |      117, 137      | Parsing, Regex          |         |
