Time to find out why people like Rust so much 👀

|     Day     | Tags | Remarks |
|:-----------:|------|---------|
| [1](day01)  | Maths | |
| [2](day02)  | Brute Force | |
| [3](day03)  | DP | |
| [4](day04)  | 2D Array, BFS/DFS | |
| [5](day05)  | Sorting, Intervals | |
| [6](day06)  | Parsing, Maths | |
| [7](day07)  | DP, Counting | |
| [8](day08)  | Minimum Spanning Tree, Kruskal's Algorithm, Disjoint Set Union | Feels good to be able to mix code from different paradigms in Rust, e.g. functional programming, procedural programming, a little OOP |
| [9](day09)  | Ray Casting Algorithm, Coordinate Compression, 2D Prefix Sums | Challenging problem, especially if you want to solve it efficiently and correctly handle edge cases |
| [10](day10) | Divide & Conquer, Top-down DP, Recursive Backtracking, Bitmasks, Gauss-Jordan Elimination, OOP | Another toughie. The obvious linalg solution is tedious to implement (by hand), while the graceful solution is harder to spot. Got a bunch more practice using different Rust features though, which was satisfying |
| [11](day11) | Topological Sort, BFS/DFS, DP | |
| [12](day12) | NP-hard, Heuristics, Brute Force, Recursive Backtracking, Bitmasks | Originally only noticed half the joke, so I relied on a Python brute force checker for cases where the grid is big enough for the total area of the shapes. Was about to go back to the drawing board when the checker took almost 10s on the sample input, but then I accidentally ran the program on the real input and it finished immediately... |
