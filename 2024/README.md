I've always wanted to learn a functional programming language, and it seems now is finally the time for me to learn one. This year I aim to familiarise myself with OCaml and write clean solutions to the puzzles in AoC.

There will also be hastily written (read: poorly written) Python solutions lying around, as sort of a warmup and also cos I'm itching to solve the puzzles as fast as I can.

|     Day     | Tags | Remarks |
|:-----------:|------|---------|
| [1](Day01)  | Sorting, Hashing | |
| [2](Day02)  | Brute Force | |
| [3](Day03)  | Regex | |
| [4](Day04)  | 2D Array, Regex | [Regex](Day04/regex.py) is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural |
| [5](Day05)  | Hashing, Sorting | |
| [6](Day06)  | 2D Array, Simulation, Set | May have overengineered this one just a wee bit |
| [7](Day07)  | Brute Force, Higher-order Functions | Perfect problem for functional programming, very satisfying! |
| [8](Day08)  | Brute Force, Geometry, Hashing | |
| [9](Day09)  | Two Pointers, Priority Queue | |
| [10](Day10) | BFS/DFS, DAG | Counting paths in a DAG. Would need DP if grid and trail lengths were larger |
| [11](Day11) | Memoization, DP | Another good day for FP. The solution is literally just do what the problem says, then slap a cache on it! |
| [12](Day12) | Flood Fill, Geometry | Really happy to find a short, sweet way to count sides correctly. Might even be easier than counting corners! |
| [13](Day13) | Mathematics, Linear Algebra | |
| [14](Day14) | Simulation, Investigation, Statistics, Chinese Remainder Theorem | Getting jumpscared by a tree in my terminal was not on my bingo card, and I love it |
| [15](Day15) | Simulation, BFS/DFS, Topological Sort, Sokoban | |
| [16](Day16) | Dijkstra, DP | |
| [17](Day17) | Simulation, Reverse Engineering, Bitwise Operations, Recursive Backtracking | Part 2 was really fun to figure out! |
| [18](Day18) | BFS, Binary Search, Disjoint Set Union | Seems like there's lots of different ways to solve part 2 |
| [19](Day19) | DP, Strings, Higher-order Functions | Had fun abstracting the logic for both parts into a single higher order function |
| [20](Day20) | BFS/DFS, Precomputation, Brute Force | |
