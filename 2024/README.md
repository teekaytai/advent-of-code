I've always wanted to learn a functional programming language, and it seems now is finally the time for me to learn one. This year I aim to familiarise myself with OCaml and write clean solutions to the puzzles in AoC.

There will also be hastily written (read: poorly written) Python solutions lying around, as sort of a warmup and also cos I'm itching to solve the puzzles as fast as I can.

| [4](Day04)  | 2D Array, Regex                     | [Regex](Day04/regex.py) is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural                          |
| [5](Day05)  | Hashing, Sorting                    |                                                                                                               |
| [6](Day06)  | 2D Array, Simulation, Set           | May have overengineered this one just a wee bit                                                               |
| [7](Day07)  | Brute force, Higher-order functions | Perfect problem for functional programming, very satisfying!                                                  |
| [8](Day08)  | Brute force, Geometry, Hashing      |                                                                                                               |
| [9](Day09)  | Two pointers, Priority queue        |                                                                                                               |
| [10](Day10) | BFS/DFS, DAG                        | Counting paths in a DAG. Would need DP if grid and trail lengths were larger                                  |
| [11](Day11) | Memoization, DP                     | Another good day for FP. The solution is literally just do what the problem says, then slap a cache on it!    |
| [12](Day12) | Flood Fill                          | Really happy to find a short, sweet way to count sides correctly. Might even be easier than counting corners! |
