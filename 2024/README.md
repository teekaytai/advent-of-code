I've always wanted to learn a functional programming language, and it seems now is finally the time for me to learn one. This year I aim to familiarise myself with OCaml and write clean solutions to the puzzles in AoC.

There will also be hastily written (read: poorly written) Python solutions lying around, as sort of a warmup and also cos I'm itching to solve the puzzles as fast as I can.
